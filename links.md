These links are useful for me;

1. [Install Putty on your Mac Silicon based computer](https://rajivverma.me/blog/tech/how-to-install-putty-on-macbook-air-m1/)<br>
Since I am a Mac Silicon user, downloading applications is not that easy. I try to kept up with OS assignments and found this link so i can install putty. 

2. [Made this page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)<br>
