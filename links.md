These links are useful for me;

## W01 ü§©
1. [Install Putty on your Mac Silicon based computer](https://rajivverma.me/blog/tech/how-to-install-putty-on-macbook-air-m1/)<br>
Since I am a Mac Silicon user, downloading applications is not that easy. I try to kept up with OS assignments and found this link so i can install putty. 

2. [Made this page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)<br>
This link actually on the W01 Assignment #3 page but it does help me to made this page. By the way, you must be **patient** and don't forget to refresh your page to see the changes.

## W02 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1. [Authentication on Operating System](https://codescracker.com/operating-system/user-authentication.htm)<br>
I am curious about authentication in operating system  since it appears on weekly quiz. 

## W03 üìÅ
1. [Encrypting you file with Public Key/Asymmetrically](https://www.howtogeek.com/427982/how-to-encrypt-and-decrypt-files-with-gpg-on-linux/)<br>
Find out how to encrypt your file asymmetrically here. They describe why we need to use some codes like --sign, --armor, etc.

2. [Edit any text files on your Debian!](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-tutorial/ch-editor.html)<br>
In case you are still adding or editing your text files via github or your device editor (not via virtualbox). You can read here what codes to use.

3. [File System in Operating System #GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-systems-in-operating-system/)<br>
This page summarizing about file system. Giving another insights about file system.

4. [File System Implementation in Operating System #GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-system-implementation-in-operating-system/)<br>
This page also summarizing about file system implementation. But, I think their article is a bit different than silberchartz.

## W04 üìá
1. [Making Makefile](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/)<br>
Since One of this week POP QUIZ(zes) is encrypt a file with Makefile, maybe you need to know how to make it via this website. It helps me, but sir RMS's Makefile source code is much better.

2. [Memory Addressing in C for dummies](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_memory_address.php)<br>
Recently we studied about memory allocation. This page helps me to understand :D

3. [Pointer in C](https://www.guru99.com/c-pointers.html)<br>
Beside the memory thingy, you - I need to know how pointer(s) work. Read this to help you :)!

## W05 üë®‚Äçüíª
1. [Virtual Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Another short reference beside the Silberchartz. Personally, I think it's quite general but we could get more knowledge how to understand and explain it generally.

2. [Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/optimal-page-replacement-algorithm/?ref=rp)<br>
We learn about page replacement this week especially the FIFO methods. If you interested, here is the algorithm for Optimal Page Replacement.

3. [LRU Page Replacement Program](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-least-recently-used-lru-page-replacement-algorithm/)<br>
For me, seeing this as a program and seeing the example makes me understand better. 

## W06 üç¥
1. [Forking things](https://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411.ck/www/NOTES/process/fork/create.html) <br>
This link summarize all you need to know about fork in operating system. They put some code visualizations that might help you.

2. [Difference Between Wait and Sleep](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/software-technology/difference-between-sleep-and-wait/)<br>
We need to understand the differences between them to use them correctly. In case you're still confused, maybe this link can help you to understand the concept better.

3. [Find your process's PID and PPID](https://linuxhandbook.com/find-process-id/)<br>
We know what to write on PID and PPID columns in exam questions. But how about the real process we do on our virtual box? You can found it here.

## W07 üîó
1. [Process Synchronization and Deadlocks](https://humphryscomputing.com/Notes/OS/synch.html)<br>
This page gave me some examples about process synchronization and deadlocks. The writer also provide some simple sketches to help us understand better. I think this page is more suitable if you are know what is process synchronization and deadlocks first.

2. [How to prevent Deadlocks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/)<br>
We don't want deadlocks. This page gave us some advice(s) to prevent deadlocks happen.

3. [Detect deadlock and recover from it](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-detection-recovery/?ref=rp)<br>
Beside the prevention, we should know how to face it. This page gave me some informations about how to detect the deadlock and how to recover our processes.

## W08 ‚å®Ô∏è
1. [Linux From Scratch (ID)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m3jE0RUbUk&list=PL0gOYtekW0nvpS6LdyG9IgJm_2r5ldWbP)<br>
Starting this week, our assignments are about to do Linux From Scratch (LFS). This is a youtube playlist from sxurce cxde about how to do LFS. I think their playlist is useful especially for someone who needs verbal instructions instead of read them from the LFS books.

2. [Process Scheduling](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/6_CPU_Scheduling.html)<br>
This page gives some summary about process scheduling in operating system. The source of it is same with our lecturer recommendation book from Silberschatz

3. [Multiple-Processor Process Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)<br>
This page explains a deeper understanding about multiprocessor scheduling.
